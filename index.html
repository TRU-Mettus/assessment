 <p>
      The Integration & Workflow shows how TRU-Mettus functions as the unifying bridge between all key players in the talent ecosystem.

Candidates: Individuals who submit their skills, credentials, and experience.

TRU-Mettus: The central hub that collects candidate data, verifies credentials, and ensures reliability.

Employers: Organizations seeking trustworthy, verified talent to reduce hiring risks.

Verification Systems (MIE + XDS): External background check and verification providers that validate qualifications, employment history, and other critical data.<br><br>

By connecting these elements: <br>

1. Candidates are able to prove their reliability.<br>

2. Employers gain confidence in making informed hiring decisions.<br>

3. Verification partners (MIE + XDS) ensure the data is accurate and trustworthy.<br><br>

This workflow ensures that every party is aligned, creating a transparent and reliable ecosystem for talent validation and recruitment.

  <h2 class="bio-text">How they can be combined </h2>
  <p class="bio-para">

Think of TRU-Mettus as the bridge:<br>

XDS feeds financial & credit reliability into the system.

Example: “Does this candidate have a trustworthy credit history if applying for a financial role?”<br>

MIE feeds professional & skills verification into the system.<br>

Example: “Does this candidate really have that Computer Science degree or software certification?”<br>

TRU-Mettus unifies both to give employers one reliable profile of a candidate:<br>

“Financially responsible + Skills verified = True reliability.”

 <div class="biography">
  <h2 class="bio-text">Why this makes sense for Mettus</h2>
  <p class="bio-para">

Instead of working as two separate silos, combining XDS (credit trust) and MIE (skills trust) creates a full 360° reliability system.<br>

It becomes a unique selling point, no other South African (or African) company offers a single solution combining both.
